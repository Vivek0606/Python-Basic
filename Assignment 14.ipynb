    "Q 1. What does RGBA stand for?\n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "RGBA stands for \"Red, Green, Blue, Alpha\" and is a color model used in computer graphics and image processing.    \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q 2. From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any images?\n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "To get the RGBA value of any image using the Pillow module in Python, we can use the `getpixel()` method of the `Image` class. This method returns the pixel value at a specified position in the image as a tuple of RGBA values.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 3. What is a box tuple, and how does it work?\n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "A box tuple is a tuple value of four integers: the left-edge x-coordinate, the top-edge y-coordinate, the width, and the height, respectively.    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 4. Use your image and load in notebook then, How can you find out the width and height of an Image object?\n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "To find out the width and height of an `Image` object using the Pillow module in Python, we can use the `size` attribute of the `Image` object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open the image file\n",
    "img = Image.open(\"my_image.png\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the size of the image (width, height)\n",
    "width, height = img.size\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the width and height\n",
    "print(f\"The image size is {width}x{height} pixels.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q 5. What method would you call to get Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it?\n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "img.crop((0, 50, 50, 50)) #Notice that you are passing a box tuple to crop(), not four separate integer arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 6. After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?\n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "To save changes made to an `Image` object as an image file using the Pillow module in Python, we can use the `save()` method of the `Image` class. This method takes a filename as an argument and saves the image to that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open the original image\n",
    "img = Image.open(\"my_image.png\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Apply a rotation transformation\n",
    "rotated_img = img.rotate(45)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save the rotated image to a new file\n",
    "rotated_img.save(\"my_rotated_image.png\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 7. What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?\n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "The ImageDraw module contains code to draw on images.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 8. Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind of object?\n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "ImageDraw objects have shape-drawing methods such as point(), line(), or rectangle(). They are returned by passing the Image object to the ImageDraw.Draw() function.\n",
