    "Q 1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?\n",
    "--> The Boolean data type in Python has two possible values: True and False. These values represent the truth values of logical statements or conditions, where True represents a condition that is true and False represents a condition that is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the Boolean values are written as keywords, True and False, with the first letter capitalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?\n",
    "--> The three different types of Boolean operators in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "and: The and operator returns True if both operands are True, and False otherwise. For example, True and False is False, while True and True is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "or: The or operator returns True if at least one of the operands is True, and False otherwise. For example, True or False is True, while False or False is False.\n",
    "\n",
    "not: The not operator returns the opposite of the operand's truth value. If the operand is True, not will return False, and if the operand is False, not will return True. For example, not True is False, while not False is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).\n",
    "--> Here are the truth tables for the three Boolean operators in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### AND (`and`) Truth Table\n",

    " `True`     `False`    `False`\n",
    " `True`     `True`     `True` \n",

    "### OR (`or`) Truth Table\n",
    "\n",
    " Operand 1  Operand 2  Result \n",
    " ---------  ---------  ------ \n",
    " `False`    `False`    `False`\n",
    " `False`    `True`     `True` \n",
    " `True`     `False`    `True` \n",
    " `True`     `True`     `True` \n",

    " Operand  Result \n",
    " -------  ------ \n",
    " `False`  `True` \n",
    " `True`   `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of these truth tables, the operands represent Boolean values (`True` or `False`), and the result column shows the result of applying the corresponding Boolean operator to the operands. The truth tables show all possible combinations of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluates to.\n",

    "Q 5. What are the six comparison operators?    \n",
    "--> The six comparison operators in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "> (greater than)\n",
    "< (less than)\n",
    ">= (greater than or equal to)\n",
    "<= (less than or equal to)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.\n",
    "--> In Python, the equal to operator is denoted by `==` (two equal signs) and the assignment operator is denoted by `=` (single equal sign). The equal to operator is used to compare two values for equality, while the assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 5      # Assignment statement - assigns the value 5 to variable x\n",
    "y = 10     # Assignment statement - assigns the value 10 to variable y\n",
    "\n",
    "if x == y:   # Comparison expression - checks if the values of x and y are equal\n",
    "    print(\"x and y are equal\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x and y are not equal\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, the assignment operator is used to assign the values 5 and 10 to variables `x` and `y`, respectively. The equal to operator is used in the `if` statement to check if the values of `x` and `y` are equal. If they are equal, the message \"x and y are equal\" is printed. Otherwise, the message \"x and y are not equal\" is printed.\n",

    "Q 7. Identify the three blocks in this code:\n",

    "--> The code has three blocks. Here's how the blocks can be identified:\n",

    "if spam == 1:\n",

    "Q 9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?\n",
    "-->  If your program is stuck in an endless loop and is not responding, you can press Ctrl+C on your keyboard to terminate the program. This will send a keyboard interrupt signal to the Python interpreter, which will stop the execution of the program immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?\n",
    "--> The `break` statement is used to terminate the current loop (for loop, while loop, or do-while loop) and resume the next statement after the loop. It is typically used when a specific condition is met and you want to exit the loop early. When the `break` statement is executed, the control flow jumps to the statement immediately following the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. It is typically used when a specific condition is met and you want to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration and move on to the next iteration. When the `continue` statement is executed, the control flow jumps to the beginning of the loop and starts the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main difference between `break` and `continue` is that `break` terminates the loop, while `continue` skips the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?\n",
    "--> In Python, the `range()` function is commonly used in for loops to generate a sequence of numbers. It takes three arguments: `start`, `stop`, and `step`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`range(10)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9 (10 numbers in total) with a default step of 1. It is equivalent to `range(0, 10, 1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`range(0, 10)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9 (10 numbers in total) with a default step of 1. The first argument `0` is the starting point of the sequence, and the second argument `10` is the ending point of the sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "`range(0, 10, 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9 (10 numbers in total) with a step of 1. The first argument `0` is the starting point of the sequence, the second argument `10` is the ending point of the sequence, and the third argument `1` is the step size.\n",

    "Q 12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.\n",
    "--> Here's a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a `for` loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for i in range(1, 11):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And here's an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a `while` loop:\n",

    "```\n",
    "i = 1\n",
