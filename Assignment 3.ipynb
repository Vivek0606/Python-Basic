    "Q 1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "Functions reduce the need for duplicate code. This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "ANSWER:- \n",
    "The code in a function runs when the function is called, not when it is specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "In Python, the statement that creates a function is the def keyword, which is short for \"define\". Here is the basic syntax for creating a function in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "    # Function body: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q 4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "In Python, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called or invoked from other parts of the program. A function call, on the other hand, is the act of invoking or executing a function with a specific set of arguments or parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Function definition\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Function call\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "The number of global scopes in a Python program is one, while the number of local scopes can be as many as the number of functions or blocks defined in the program, which can vary depending on the size and complexity of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "When a function call returns in Python, all the variables that were defined in its local scope are deallocated from memory. This means that any variables, objects, or values that were created or modified inside the function are no longer accessible or visible from outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "In Python, a return value is the value that a function returns or sends back to the caller when it completes its execution. It is a way for a function to communicate the result of its computation or task to the rest of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it is possible to have a return value in an expression. In Python, functions can be used as expressions that return values that can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, or used in other expressions. \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "result = add_numbers(5, 10) * 2\n",
    "print(result)   # Output: 30\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "ANSWER:- \n",
    "If a function does not have a `return` statement, the return value of a call to that function is `None` in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def print_message():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "result = print_message()\n",
    "print(result)   # Output: None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 9.How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "In Python, if you want to make a function variable refer to the global variable with the same name, you can use the `global` keyword. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    global x\n",
    "    x = 20\n",
    "    print(\"The value of x inside the function is:\", x)\n",
    "\n",
    "my_function()\n",
    "print(\"The value of x outside the function is:\", x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "OUTPUT: \n",
    "\n",
    "The value of x inside the function is: 20\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of x outside the function is: 20\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "The data type of `None` is `NoneType`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "ANSWER:- \n",
    "That import statement imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "This function can be called with spam.bacon().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q 13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error? \n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "Place the line of code that might cause an error in a try clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "The code that could potentially cause an error goes in the try clause.\n",
    "-The code that executes if an error happens goes in the except clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
