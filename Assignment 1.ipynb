    "Q1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "* \n",
    "'hello'\n",
    "-87.8\n",
    "- \n",
    "/ \n",
    "+\t\n",
    "6 \n",
    "\n",
    "--> VALUES:- 'hello' , -87.8, 6\n",
    "    EXPRESSION:- *, -, /, + \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "--> In Python, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed within either single quotes ('...') or double quotes (\"...\"). For example, 'hello' and \"world\" are both strings in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a variable is a name that refers to a value or an object in memory. In Python, variables can be assigned to different data types, including strings. A variable is essentially a placeholder that stores a value for later use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "-->  Here are three of the most commonly used data types in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer (int): An integer is a whole number with no decimal point. In Python, integers can be positive or negative, and there is no limit to how large or small an integer can be. For example, 5, -2, and 1000 are all integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Float: A float is a number with a decimal point. Floats are used to represent real numbers, such as 3.14 or -0.5. In Python, floats are typically represented with a decimal point or in scientific notation (e.g. 1.23e-4).\n",
    "\n",
    "String (str): A string is a sequence of characters that is enclosed in either single or double quotes. Strings can contain any combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. For example, 'Hello, world!' and \"Python is awesome!\" are both strings. In Python, strings are immutable, which means that once a string is created, it cannot be changed. However, you can create new strings by concatenating or slicing existing strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "--> In Python, an expression is a combination of one or more values, variables, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated to produce a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "All expressions in Python are designed to produce a value or a result when they are evaluated. The result of an expression can be of any data type, including integers, floats, strings, or even more complex data types like lists or dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions can be used in a variety of ways in Python programs, such as assigning values to variables, performing mathematical calculations, or making decisions based on the result of a comparison or logical operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "-->  The main difference between an expression and a statement is that an expression always produces a value, while a statement doesn't necessarily do so. In the case of an assignment statement like spam = 10, the statement assigns the value of 10 to the variable spam, but it doesn't produce a value itself. However, the expression 10 in the statement does produce a value, which is the integer 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, expressions are used to compute values or results, while statements are used to perform actions or control the flow of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. . After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "--> After running the following code, the variable bacon will still contain the integer value of 22.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam'\n",
    "'spam' * 3\n",
    "--> The values of the following two terms should be the same:\n",
    "\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam': This expression concatenates two strings, 'spam' and 'spamspam', to produce a new string 'spamspamspam'.\n",
    "\n",
    "'spam' * 3: This expression multiplies the string 'spam' by the integer 3, which repeats the string three times and produces the same string 'spamspamspam'.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, both expressions will result in the string 'spamspamspam'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "--> A variable name must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_). The rest of the variable name can contain letters, numbers, and underscores. 100 is not a valid variable name because it starts with a number, which violates the rule that Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore, so names like 'eggs' would be valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "--> int(): This function can be used to convert a value to an integer. If the value is a floating-point number, it will be rounded down to the nearest integer. \n",
    "\n",
    "float(): This function can be used to convert a value to a floating-point number. If the value is an integer, it will be converted to a float with a decimal point. \n",
    "\n",
    "str(): This function can be used to convert a value to a string. It will create a string representation of the value, which can be used for printing or concatenation with other strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "--> This expression causes an error because it tries to concatenate a string ('I have eaten ') with an integer (99) using the + operator. In Python, concatenation only works between strings, so you can't concatenate an integer directly with a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this error, we need to convert the integer 99 to a string before concatenating it with the other string. \n",
    "For Example: 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.' or \n",
    "                'I have eaten ' + '99' + ' burritos.'\n",
    "\n"
