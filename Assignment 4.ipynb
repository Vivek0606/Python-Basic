    "Q 2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "spam = [2,4,6,8,10]\n",
    "spam[2] = 'hello'\n",

    "Q 10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "ANSWER:- \n",

    "Q 12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "Both lists and strings can be passed to len(), have indexes and slices, be used in for loops, be concatenated or replicated, and be used with the in and not in operators.\n",

    "\n",
    "Q 13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "Lists are mutable; they can have values added, removed, or changed. Tuples are immutable; they cannot be changed at all. Also, tuples are written using parentheses, (  ), while lists use the square brackets, [  ].\n",

    "Q 15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "To get a list value's tuple form, we can use the built-in `tuple()` function. \n",

    "Q 16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",

    "Q 17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "The copy.copy() function will do a shallow copy of a list, while the copy.deepcopy() function will do a deep copy of a list. That is, only copy.deepcopy() will duplicate any lists inside the list.\n",
